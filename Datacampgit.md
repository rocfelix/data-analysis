#Basic Workflow
repository has two parts:
1. Files
2. Directories


Git stores all of its extra information in a directory called '.git'

Suppose your home directory /home/repl contains a repository called dental, which has a sub-directory called data. Where is information about the history of the files in /home/repl/dental/data stored?

Answer: /home/repl/dental/.git
